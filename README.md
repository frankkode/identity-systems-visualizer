## 🔍 Overview

This application visualizes the research findings from the thesis "Blockchain-based and Traditional Digital Identity Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Security and Practicality." It provides an interactive way to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and use cases of different identity system architectures.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Architecture Diagrams**: Visualize the components and data flows of traditional, blockchain-based, and hybrid identity systems
- **Animated Data Flow**: Step-by-step visualization of how data moves through each system
- **Comparative Analysis Dashboard**: Side-by-side comparison of key metrics like security, privacy, scalability, and cost
- **Use Case Explorer**: Detailed examination of industry-specific implementations including healthcare, finance, and government ID
- **Performance Metrics**: Visual representation of benchmark data across different systems
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing
